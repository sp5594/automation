# Automation for a website using Selenium+JUnit and JAVA.
This project was created for a start up that no longer exists. The automation project was abandoned at a very early stage along with the
product itself. Regardless, I was still able to achieve the basic framework setup, pom and some tests.

Technologies used:
- Selenium
- JUnit Framework
- ChromeDriver
- POM 
- JAVA

Each page has its own class. For ex: Landing Page = landingpage.class, My Feed = myfeed.class. Each class contains all the elements that 
are found on that page. For instance, on the landing page/landingpage.class you will find all the elements that are related to registration 
and login. All the elements are found using "ID" identifier. For each element, there is a method on how to interact with it. We can click on it or send a value to it.
