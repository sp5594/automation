Each page has its own class. For ex: Landing Page = landingpage.class, My Feed = myfeed.class. Each class contains all the elements that 
are found on that page. For instance, on the landing page/landingpage.class you will find all the elements that are related to registration 
and login. All the elements are found using "ID" identifier. For each element, there is a method on how to interact with it. We can click on it
or send a value to it.
